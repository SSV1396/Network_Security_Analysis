# Network_Security_Analysis
## ABOUT
This Project focuses on the Network Topologies and implementation and architecture of system design in XYZ Company(For security reasons cannot disclose the Company name). In this project as a study case of IT security plans and policies of XYZ Company Network Security Analysis are used as a source of understanding and implementation of the security policies in an organization and implementation of real time procedure and practices in organization in security plan analysis. Several recommendations are also made according to the importance to prevent security breaches from occurring. 
 ## Part I: Identify a local company for  project
 The selected Company is XYZ.
As a company that specializes in offering IT and consulting services, This Company limited adopted an office network standard that is similar to the one adopted by many Western companies. Two important domains in the company's network are physical and logical topology. These layers are important in networking as they are responsible for the connection of computers as well as enabling them to connect to the internet.
The diagram below gives an overview of the physical topology of the  Company network. The organization uses local area network (LAN) connection shared printers.

XYZ company LAN consisted of PCs and auxiliary equipment connected to a local domain server. All network devices use common printers or storage resources in this network configuration. The LAN has wires and cables for network connection. The network's logical topology gives an overview of how physical devices such as computers and printers are connected in the company's network, mainly composed of network cables that transmit data. This topology defines mainly how the various systems communicate across the network. The company used various hardware and software to secure its network. The software includes Anti-malware software, a firewall that would secure the network from intrusion by cybercriminals, Network anomaly detection engines (ADE) that would alert the system admins of any suspicious activity, and Avana Cloud Email Security for securing emails of the organization entering the network (Wang, Smahi, et al., 2022). XYZ company also employed the Proxy server to enhance the security of its system and network at large.

## Part II: Security Assessment and Preventative Measures Discovery Stage 
XYZ company has several security policies to secure the organization's network from possible cyberattacks. These rules include the Security Awareness and Training Policy, which mandates that all workforce employees receive training and awareness to carry out their duties defend adequately protect firm information. The organization must ensure that changes to a computer network and systems are handled, approved, and monitored under the other policy, which is the change management policy. Last but not company's Password Creation and Management Policy offers principles that guide, implement, and review defined procedures for establishing, maintaining, and properly protecting complex passwords which are used to verify user identities and give access to company systems or material data.

 Due to the recent incidences of hacking and other cyberattacks, the company opted for training on information security to minimize its system's vulnerability. The first training was conducted in the summer of this year with the IT department, and the company is arranging for the second training after the end of winter. The head of the IT department coordinates the program according to him, it is intended to help users and staff members understand how they may contribute to the fight against information security breaches. Staff members that participate in effective security awareness training are better able to understand good cyber hygiene, the security dangers posed by their activities, and how to detect cyberattacks when using emails. Apart from training, the company approved the request of the IT to increase the budget spent on securing the network, including the acquisition of new computers, additional and more powerful anti-spyware, and more sophisticated firewalls that handle the increasing network traffic.
 
The current system used by the company is vulnerable to threats and vulnerabilities from different aspects, and these vulnerabilities can hinder the activities of the business in various ways. Recently, there have been many cases of DoS attacks, with the main threats posed by flooding DoS attacks and server failure. The company's computer systems are susceptible to flood attacks, particularly when the attacked system is overloaded with a lot of traffic that the server can't handle. The system eventually fails, which could negatively impact business operations. A malicious actor who gains access to the network, let's say, from the building across the street, ends spoofed packets of information that hit each computer in the network, taking full advantage of the poorly configured company's network, is said to have used the most common type of flood attack in which the system appeared to be so vulnerable. A message to start the handshake is sent to the intended server, but it is never completed. The linked port is now open and available to handle new requests.

Meanwhile, the cybercriminal continues sending more requests, overwhelming all open ports and shutting down the server. The disruption of the daily operations of the server can result in the failure of the server, which may cripple the organization's operations due to the unavailability of the network services. Many sources constantly threaten every business, and XYZ Consulting Limited is not exempted from the list. Some computers especially were running on OS that was either outdated or was not up-to-date, and this made them vulnerable to attacks or could the systems be running the application and potentially the entire network. The inability to solve these security issues could result in more sophisticated attacks, such as distributed denial of service (DDoS) or denial of service (DoS) attacks, which can bring a network to a standstill or prevent users from accessing it at all. Once they gain access to the system, the attackers can launch a targeted attack on the company's finances and software resulting in business crises. The organization also faces the threat of data theft, which may disrupt the business's operations for a specific period.

## PART- III Security Plan Analysis

Regarding the security analysis of the organization's security, I interviewed the head of the IT department and the network administrator, and I would designate them titles deep and NetAdmin. My interview with iTDep went well, and there were a few things to pick up during our session with him on the security status of the system of the organization. He revealed that he was happy with the steps the organization has taken to improve the security status of its systems and their recent requests for more financial requests to improve the security of the company's information systems. However, some notable security needs to be addressed as they pose huge risks to the system, i.e., making it vulnerable to potential attacks. Some of these risks include depreciated physical security for the server, as many staff members could access the room. 

Despite receiving training on information security awareness last summer, many employees still needed to follow the guidelines laid down for them, which increased the system's vulnerability (Chuck, 2018). Another security concern I noticed was that some computer systems, especially those in the consultancy section, were running on older versions of Windows, and some soft wares systems were not up to date. This posed the risk of exposing the whole network if an attacker got through the network.

##  PART IV: Recommendation    
Based on the above analysis of the various types of threats and vulnerabilities, here is my list of recommendations that the company can implement to improve the security of their information system.

•	All employees, especially those working in the Consultancy Department, should update and patch the software on which their computers are running. 
•	 The company needs to acquire antimalware and antivirus and purchase firewall software programs instead of relying on the conventional ones provided by Microsoft Windows OS.
•	• Rather than hosting the workshops every summer, the organization should do ongoing security awareness training to inform staff of the risks posed by various virus kinds and to promote prudence when opening links and downloading files.
•	Concerning the threats of password attacks the company may face, XYZ Consulting Company should mandate multifactor-factor authentication on all accounts conducting business operations. Additionally, the IT Department should offer quick training to all staff members on creating strong passwords and encourage using a password manager to generate them. 
• The company should purchase commercial software like Microsoft Exchange Online Protection and Microsoft Defender for Office 365, which provide enterprise-class dependability and protection against spam and malware while maintaining access to email during and after emergencies, as the final recommendation against phishing attacks. This program can offer numerous spam filtering controls, including bulk mail restrictions and foreign spam controls, which will further improve the company's protection service.

 ## Narrative Essay
Obtaining a company to use for this interview was a challenging task to accomplish. Most companies I approached were reluctant to give me access to their networks, hardware devices, and information systems.  Many cited the recent spike in cyber-attack cases led by many private companies, especially in the United States and Europe. 
The companies argued that they were afraid the findings of my work could be accessed by third parties who could utilize the materials to launch cyber-attacks against their companies, and the decision not to give me access was t the security of their information systems.  After several failed attempts the American companies, I decided to try my luck with companies in Europe with greater interest in companies in the UK, France, and Germany. My initial efforts to find a company in France and UK were futile, but I eventually found one in Germany. I was grateful to Company for allowing me to use their policies for my research purposes. The experience was a good one, and the interaction with staff at the IT department can be best described as warm and educative there were plenty of lessons relevant to the career that I picked from the team from the main offices in the Capital to the field offices.
 Despite the overwhelmingly warm welcome I received from the company, there were still some challenges t I encountered during the process. For example, when understanding data on the physical network's physical and logical topology, during virtual session to let me carry out my research as they were worried about the security of their systems. It took the intervention of the head of the IT department for the staff to allow me to research the policies.

Eventually, I was given Information, and it became clear that I had to straighten things with the team for my project so I would be given adequate Information about the company’s assets for a seamless research session. It was an uphill task, but I eventually managed to convince them and win their trust.

Afterward, I had an easy time navigating through the infrastructure and collecting the data that I needed for study. I was glad I was assigned one of the technicians to help me understand the company’s giant network facilities and information system.  Generally, the session was interactive and educative and, I am glad for the few things I learned at the company.
